## Project Description
This project shall aim to both, highlight important findings, and provided Data analysis with a comprehensive dashboard on consumer complaint about banking products in the U.S from 2013 to 2019.

## Key Take Aways & Final Product

- **Complaints trend over last 7 years:** ![Trend](https://github.com/MajedAlqawasmi/final_project_ironhac/blob/main/complaints_over_years.PNG) Trend is pointing upward therefore some action might be needed
- **Top 5 products in terms of numbers of complaints in top 20 banks:** ![Top 5 products](https://github.com/MajedAlqawasmi/final_project_ironhac/blob/main/top5product20banks.PNG) Number of complaints for each product is proportionate to companies' sizes
- **Top Companies Compaints Wise & Their Bank Rank (Assets):** ![Top Companies Compaints Wise](https://github.com/MajedAlqawasmi/final_project_ironhac/blob/main/top_bank_compliants-wise.PNG) Some organisations that might need some scrutiny
- **Consumer's sentiment:** ![Consumer's sentiment](https://github.com/MajedAlqawasmi/final_project_ironhac/blob/main/consumer_sentiment.PNG) American cunsumer seems to mainatain objectivity and lack of polarity over the years
- **Map & Cultural Considerations:** ![Cultural Considerations](https://github.com/MajedAlqawasmi/final_project_ironhac/blob/main/sentiment_map.PNG) Extra training may be provided to employees in the hightlighted states
- **Products Susceptible to Fraud Related:** ![Fraud](https://github.com/MajedAlqawasmi/final_project_ironhac/blob/main/products_susceptible_fraud.PNG) From 2013 to 2019, we see a sharp increase in cryptocurrency related activity comparing to previous years. This can be of interest to Federal AML regulatory body
- **Products with Response Tardiness:** ![Tardiness](https://github.com/MajedAlqawasmi/final_project_ironhac/blob/main/products_tardiness.PNG) To customers to whom it may concern and a direct communication with chief compliance officer from the regulator might be needed
